* Client adds 2 metric names for ping time and data size (TODO implicit for type=URL ?)
* Inventory informs the "pinger" that starts working
* Pinger reports metrics to Metrics module
* Clients requests metrics data for the metrics names above
* Client defines an alert against one of the metrics of the resource
